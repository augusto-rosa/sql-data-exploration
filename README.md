# üåç COVID-19 Data Exploration using Microsoft SQL Server

This project aims to perform a **data exploration analysis** using **Microsoft SQL Server** with public data from the [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) project, which tracks the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

---

## üìä Project Goals

Explore and analyze global COVID-19 data to identify meaningful patterns, trends, and actionable insights such as:
- Total number of confirmed cases and deaths by country and by continent
- Mortality rate (total deaths per confirmed cases) by country and region
- Time-based evolution of confirmed cases, deaths, and vaccinations
- Percentage of the population infected and vaccinated per country
- Relationship between vaccination rates, case numbers, and mortality
- Comparative analysis of the most affected countries
- Data consolidation using **Views**, **Temporary Tables**, and **CTEs** for future visualizations and reporting

## üîç Why I Built This Project
**The main motivation behind this project was to deepen my SQL skills by working with real and relevant data**. I used publicly available COVID-19 data from Our World in Data to perform meaningful and practical data exploration. 

üéØ My key objectives included:

1. **Applying SQL in a real-world context**: Working with a complex and evolving dataset.

2. **Practicing analytical queries**: Using aggregation functions, filters, ordering, and calculating key metrics such as death rates.

3. **Building a solid portfolio project**: Demonstrating my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights.

4. **Contributing to the community**: Sharing a practical example that others can study, adapt, and expand upon.

This project also gave me the opportunity to work with Microsoft SQL Server in a hands-on scenario, strengthening both my technical and analytical skills.

- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**
- **CSV file** (Source: Our World in Data)
- **Git for version control**

## ‚úÖ Conclusion and Learnings
By completing this project, I gained several valuable insights:

**Mastery of SQL for exploratory analysis**: I improved my ability to write complex queries, including joins, subqueries, and aggregate functions.

**Understanding of public health data**: I developed a better sense of how to analyze and interpret global health datasets.

**Importance of data preparatio**n: I recognized the critical role of data cleaning and transformation for accurate analysis.

**Communicating insights effectively**: I enhanced my ability to clearly and concisely communicate findings‚Äîan essential skill for data-driven decision making.

This project reinforced my passion for turning data into meaningful information and highlighted the importance of a thoughtful, data-driven approach to solving real-world problems.
